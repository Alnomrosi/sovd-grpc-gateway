## Description
This project is designed to map RestAPIs/HTTP1.1 request to gRPC/Protobuf services. SOVD server is created with gateway between SOVD Client and gRPC server. SOVD APIs are created to diagnose the application manager in a distrbuted system.

## Project structure
- proto/application_manager/sovd-grpc-interface.proto: have the SOVD APIs and its correcspoing gRPC services.
- proxy/main.go: for registering gRPC server and route requests to various registered services 
- buf.gen.yaml: is buf configuration file
